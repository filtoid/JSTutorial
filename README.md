North East Coding Newbs Javascript Tutorial

This is the repo for code which is to be part of the North East Coding Newbs tutorial. This tutorial will be at Campus North on the 26th March 2015.

This outcome will be potentially be an interactive canvas element which will show the beginnings of an asteroids clone game. 

Look at the Math.pdf for a review of some useful geometry. This is a optional but may help you better understand some of the code. 

The code provided is available for anyone to use anywhere for anything. The only stipulation is that you do not misrepresent me (Filtoid) within the comments of any code which is copied from this repo. You are free to tell people you wrote it yourself, however.
